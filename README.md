# Azure-Project-Governance
Configuring Governance with Azure Policy and Cost Management

The main objective of this project is to implement governance and cost control in Azure using Azure Policy and Cost Management tools. This ensures resources adhere to organisational policies, such as tagging requirements and helps track and manage spending by setting budget limits with alerts. These measures enhance accountability, compliance and financial efficiency in cloud resource management.
